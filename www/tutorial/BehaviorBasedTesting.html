   In the JMockit toolkit, the <code>Expectations & Verifications</code> APIs provide rich support for the creation of
   <em>behavior-based</em> unit tests.
   The focus when doing this kind of testing is on the <em>interactions</em> between the unit under test and the other
   units it depends upon. Such units of behavior are the classes, methods, and constructors defined in production code.

<p>
   An interaction between two units always takes the form of a method or constructor <em>invocation</em>.
   The set of invocations from a unit under test to its dependencies, together with the argument and
   return values passed between them, define the behavior of interest for the tests of that particular unit.
   In addition, a given test may need to verify the relative order of execution between multiple invocations.
</p>
<p>
   Note that a <em>unit</em> test only exercises the code of the <em>tested</em> unit.
   The implementation code behind dependencies is <em>not</em> meant to be exercised, since it's not part of the unit
   under test.
   So, the goal of <em>unit testing</em> is to test logical units of behavior <em>in isolation</em> from the actual
   behavior of its dependencies.
   Now, we typically do not want nor need to isolate a given unit from <em>all</em> its dependencies, but only from
   those that 1) already have (or will have, in case they are not implemented yet) their own unit tests in the
   <em>same</em> test suite; or 2) for practical reasons cannot be easily, quickly, or reliably executed in a unit test
   environment (because they write to a database, send emails, and so on).
   When coding the tests for a particular unit, we simply assume that its dependencies behave according to expectations.
   If they don't, it is the responsibility of their own tests to catch it.

<p>
   Methods and constructors invoked from the unit under test, and which belong to a dependency/collaborator of said
   unit, are the usual targets for <em>mocking</em>.
   Mocking provides the mechanism that we need in order to isolate the tested unit from (some of) its dependencies.
   We specify which particular dependencies are to be mocked for a given test (or tests) by declaring their types as
   being <em>mocked types</em>.
   That is, a mocked type should be the type of a dependency of the unit under test.
   Such a type can be any kind of <em>reference</em> type: an <code>interface</code>, a <code>class</code> (including
   <code>abstract</code> and <code>final</code> ones), an annotation, or an <code>enum</code>.
</p>
<p>
   By default, <em>all</em> methods of the mocked type will be mocked for the duration of the test.
   If the declared mocked type is a class, then all of its super-classes up to but not including
   <code class="type">java.lang.Object</code> will also be mocked, recursively.
   Therefore, inherited methods will automatically be mocked as well.
   Again in the case of a class, all of its <em>constructors</em> will also get mocked.
   Even more, whatever Java language modifiers happen to be applied to the methods/constructors of a mocked class, they
   will still get mocked: <code>private</code>, <code>static</code>, <code>final</code>, <code>native</code>, it doesn't
   really matter.
</p>
<p>
   When a method or constructor is mocked, its original implementation code won't be executed for invocations occurring
   during the test.
   Instead, the call will be redirected to JMockit so it can be dealt with in the manner that was explicitly or
   implicitly specified for the test.
</p>
<p>
   The following example test serves as a basic illustration for the declaration of mocked types.
   In this tutorial, we use many code snippets like this, where the parts in bold font are the current focus of
   explanation.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void doBusinessOperationXyz()
   {
      ...

      new Expectations() { // an "expectation block"
         <strong>Dependency</strong> mockInstance; // "Dependency" is our mocked type for this test
         ...

         {
            ...
            // "mockInstance" is a mocked instance automatically provided for use in the test
            <strong>mockInstance.mockedMethod(...);</strong>
            ...
         }
      };

      ...
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   As we will shortly see, there are several ways to declare mocked types, and also several ways in which the exact
   semantics of mocking can be modified to suit the needs of a particular test or group of tests.
   In most cases, such variations are specified through special annotations and their attributes:
   <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>, <code class="annotation">@NonStrict</code>,
   <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>, etc.
   These annotations can be applied to certain instance fields and to test method parameters.

<p>
   An <em>expectation</em> is a set of invocations to an specific mocked method/constructor that is relevant for a given
   test.
   An expectation may cover multiple different invocations to the same method or constructor, but it doesn't have to
   cover <em>all</em> such invocations that occur during the test execution.
   Whether a particular invocation matches a given expectation or not will depend not only on the method/constructor
   signature but also on runtime aspects such as the instance on which the method is invoked, argument values, and/or
   the number of invocations already matched.
   Therefore, several types of matching <em>constraints</em> can (optionally) be specified for a given expectation.
</p>
<p>
   When we have one or more invocation parameters involved, an exact argument value may be specified for each parameter.
   For example, the value <code>"test string"</code> could be specified for a <code>String</code> parameter, causing the
   expectation to match only those invocations with this exact value in the corresponding parameter.
   As we will see later, instead of specifying exact argument values, we can specify more relaxed constraints which will
   match whole sets of different argument values.
</p>
<p>
   The example below shows an expectation for <code>Dependency#someMethod(int, String)</code>, which will match an
   invocation to this method with the exact argument values as specified.
   Notice that the expectation itself is specified through an isolated invocation to the mocked method.
   There are no special API methods involved, as is common in other mocking APIs.
   This invocation, however, does not count as one of the "real" invocations we are interested in testing.
   It's only there so that the expectation can be specified.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void doBusinessOperationXyz()
   {
      ...

      new Expectations() {
         Dependency mockInstance;
         ...

         {
            ...
            // An expectation for an instance method:
            <strong>mockInstance.someMethod(1, "test");</strong>
            ...
         }
      };

      // A call to the unit under test occurs here, leading to mock invocations
      // that may or may not match specified expectations.
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   We will see more about expectations later, after we understand the differences between <em>recording</em>,
   <em>replaying</em>, and <em>verifying</em> invocations.
</p>

<h3 id="model">
   The <em>record-replay-verify</em> model
   <div class="navigation">
      <a href="../tutorial.html"><img align="right" src="go-home.png" title="Contents"></a>

   </div>
</h3>
<p>
   Any developer test can be divided in at least three separate execution <em>phases</em>.
   The phases execute sequentially, one at a time, as demonstrated below.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void someTestMethod()
   {
      // 1. Preparation: whatever is required before the unit under test can be exercised.
      ...
      // 2. The unit under test is exercised, usually by calling a public method.
      ...
      // 3. Verification: whatever needs to be checked to make sure the exercised unit
      //    did its job.
      ...
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   First, we have a preparation phase, where objects and data items needed for the test are created or obtained from
   somewhere else.
   Then, the unit under test is exercised. Finally, the results from exercising the tested unit are compared with the
   expected results.
</p>
<p>
   This model of three phases is also known as the <em>Arrange, Act, Assert syntax</em>, or "AAA" for short.
   Different words, but the meaning is the same.
</p>
<p>
   In the context of behavior-based testing with mocked types (and their mocked instances), we can identify the
   following alternative phases, which are directly related to the three previously described conventional testing
   phases:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      The <strong><em>record</em></strong> phase, during which invocations can be <em>recorded</em>.
      This happens during test preparation, <em>before</em> the invocations we want to test are executed.
   </li>
   <li>
      The <strong><em>replay</em></strong> phase, during which the mock invocations of interest have a chance to be
      executed, as the unit under test is exercised.
      The invocations to mocked methods/constructors previously recorded will now be <em>replayed</em>.
      Often there isn't a one-to-one mapping between invocations recorded and replayed, though.
   </li>
   <li>
      The <strong><em>verify</em></strong> phase, during which invocations can be <em>verified</em> to have occurred as
      expected.
      This happens during test verification, <em>after</em> the invocations under test had a chance to be executed.
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
   Behavior-based tests written with JMockit will typically fit the following templates:
</p>
<pre><code>import mockit.*;
... other imports ...

public class SomeTest
{
   // Zero or more "mock fields" common to all test methods in the class:
   @Mocked Collaborator mockCollaborator;
   @NonStrict AnotherDependency anotherDependency;
   ...

   @Test
   public void testWithRecordAndReplayOnly(mock parameters)
   {
      // Preparation code not specific to JMockit, if any.

      <strong>new Expectations()</strong> { // an "expectation block"
         // Zero or more <strong>local</strong> mock fields.

         {
            // One or more invocations to mocked types, causing expectations to be <strong>recorded</strong>.
            // Invocations to non-mocked types are also allowed anywhere inside this block.
         }
      };

      // Unit under test is exercised.

      // Verification code (JUnit/TestNG asserts), if any.
   }

   @Test
   public void testWithReplayAndVerifyOnly(mock parameters)
   {
      // Preparation code not specific to JMockit, if any.

      // Unit under test is exercised.

      <strong>new Verifications()</strong> {{ // a "verification block"
         // One or more invocations to mocked types, causing expectations to be <strong>verified</strong>.
         // Invocations to non-mocked types are also allowed anywhere inside this block.
      }};

      // Additional verification code, if any, either here or before the verification block.
   }

   @Test
   public void testWithBothRecordAndVerify(mock parameters)
   {
      // Preparation code not specific to JMockit, if any.

      <strong>new NonStrictExpectations()</strong> { // also an expectation block
         // Zero or more mock fields.
         {
            // One or more invocations to mocked types, causing expectations to be recorded.
         }
      };

      // Unit under test is exercised.

      <strong>new VerificationsInOrder()</strong> {{ // also a verification block
         // One or more invocations to mocked types, causing expectations to be verified
         // in the specified order.
      }};

      // Additional verification code, if any, either here or before the verification block.
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   There are other variations to the above templates, but the essence is that the expectation blocks belong to the
   <em>record</em> phase and come before the unit under test is exercised, while the verification blocks belong to the
   <em>verify</em> phase.
   A test method can contain any number of expectation blocks, including none. The same is true for verification blocks.
</p>
<p>
   The fact that anonymous inner classes are used to demarcate blocks of code allows us to take advantage of the
   "code folding" feature available in modern Java IDEs. The following image shows what it looks like in IntelliJ IDEA.

   </div>
</h3>
<p>
   A mocked type can be introduced either through an instance field or a parameter declaration.
   In the first case, the field belongs to the test class or to a <code class="type">mockit.Expectations</code>
   subclass (a local field inside an expectation block).
   In the second case, the parameter necessarily belongs to a test method.
</p>
<p>
   In all cases, a mock field/parameter declaration can use the <code class="type">mockit.Mocked</code> annotation
   (<code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>).
   The use of this annotation is optional for mock parameters and for mock fields declared inside expectation blocks.
   It (or another annotation for mocked types, such as <code class="annotation">@NonStrict</code>) is only required for
   mock fields declared in the test class, in order to avoid confusion with other fields the test class might have that
   are not intended for mocking.
</p>
<p>
   All kinds of Java types are valid for mock fields and parameters, except for primitive types and for array types.
   So, to make it clear, the following reference types are valid: interfaces, concrete classes, <code>abstract</code>
   classes, <code>final</code> classes, <code>enum</code> types, and annotation types.
   Note that this includes reference types from the JRE (belonging to one of the standard packages, like
   <code>java.lang</code>, <code>java.util</code>, and so on).
</p>
<p>
   For a mock parameter declared in a test method, an instance of the declared type will be automatically created by
   JMockit and passed by the JUnit/TestNG test runner when calling the test method.
   Therefore, the parameter value will never be <code>null</code>.
</p>
<p>
   For a mock field, an instance of the declared type will be automatically created by JMockit and assigned to the
   field, unless it's a <code>final</code> field.
   In such a case, a value should be created and assigned to the field explicitly in test code.
   This value can be <code>null</code>, though, which is perfectly valid for a mocked class if only constructors and
   static methods are going to be called on it.
</p>

<h4 id="mockedInstances">Mocked instances</h4>
<p>
   The mocked instances created by JMockit can be used normally in test code (for the recording and verification of
   expectations), and/or passed to the code under test. Or they may simply go unused.
   Differently from other mocking APIs, these <em>mocked</em> objects don't have to be the ones used by the unit under
   test when it calls instance methods on its dependencies.
   By default, JMockit does not care on which object a mocked instance method is called.
   This is what allows the transparent mocking of instances created directly inside code under test, when said code
   invokes constructors on brand new instances using the <code>new</code> operator.
   The classes instantiated must be covered by mocked types declared in test code, that's all.
</p>
<p>
   Finally, note that the <em>mocked instances</em> created by JMockit are similar to the traditional
   <em>mock objects</em> created by other mocking tools, but they are not the same.
   Every instance of a mocked type - whether created by JMockit or not - <em>is</em> mocked, for as long as that type
   remains mocked.
   With a more traditional mocking API, only the mock objects/instances created by the mocking tool are actually mocked.
   Most of the time, this makes little or no difference when writing tests, but it is something to keep in mind. 
</p>

<h4 id="multipleInterfaces">Mocking multiple interfaces at the same time</h4>
<p>
   Suppose the unit under test needs to be given an object which implements two or more interfaces.
   Can we get a mocked instance which satisfies this requirement?
   One way to do it would be to create a test-specific interface which extends all the interfaces required by the tested
   unit, and then use that as the mocked type.
   There is a better way though, which does not require the definition of a new interface, as the following example
   tests show.
</p>
<pre><code>public interface Dependency // an arbitrary custom interface
{
   String doSomething(boolean b);
}

public final class MultiMocksTest<strong>&lt;MultiMock extends Dependency & Runnable></strong>
{
   @Mocked <strong>MultiMock multiMock</strong>;

   @Test
   public void mockFieldWithTwoInterfaces()
   {
      new NonStrictExpectations() {{
         multiMock.doSomething(false); <em>result</em> = "test";

<p>
   In each of the tests above, two interfaces were mocked together: <code class="type">Dependency</code> plus
   <code class="type">java.lang.Runnable</code> for a mock field, and <code class="type">Dependency</code> plus
   <code class="type">java.io.Serializable</code> for a mock parameter.
   We used the <em>type variables</em> <strong><code>MultiMock</code></strong> (defined for the whole test class) and
   <strong><code>M</code></strong> (defined for a single test method) so that JMockit could know about the component
   interfaces in each case.

<p>
   For a given method with non-<code>void</code> return type, a return value can be recorded through the
   <code>Expectations#result</code> field or through the <code>Expectations#returns(Object)</code> method.
   When the method gets called in the replay phase, the specified return value will be returned to the caller (which
   normally is the unit under test).
   Either the assignment to <code>result</code> or the call to <code>returns(Object)</code> <em>must</em> appear right
   after the invocation that identifies the recorded expectation, inside an expectation block.
</p>
<p>
   If the test instead needs an exception or error to be thrown when the method is invoked, then the <code>result</code>
   field can also be used. Simply assign the desired throwable instance to it.
   In the rare case where a method actually returns exception or error objects, the <code>returns(Object)</code> method
   will have to be used to avoid the ambiguity.
   Note that the recording of exceptions/errors to be thrown is applicable to mocked methods (of any return type) as
   well as to mocked constructors.
</p>
<p>
   Multiple <em>consecutive</em> results (values to return and/or throwables to throw) can be recorded for the same
   expectation, by simply assigning the <code>result</code> field multiple times in a row.
   The recording of multiple return values and/or exceptions/errors to be thrown can be freely mixed for the same
   expectation.
   In the case of recording multiple consecutive <em>return values</em> for a given expectation, a single call to the
   <code>returns(Object, Object...)</code> method can be made.
   Also, a single assignment to the <code>result</code> field will achieve the same effect, if the value assigned to it
   is a <em>list</em> or <em>array</em> containing the consecutive values.
   For more details about this ability, see the corresponding
   <a href="../javadoc/mockit/Expectations.html#returns(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object...)">API documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The following example test records both types of results for the methods of a mocked <code>DependencyAbc</code>
   class, to be used when they are invoked from a <code>UnitUnderTest</code> class.
   Lets say the implementation of the class under test goes like this:
</p>
<pre><code>public class UnitUnderTest
{
(1)private final DependencyAbc abc = <strong>new DependencyAbc()</strong>;

   public void doSomething()
   {
(2)   int n = <strong>abc.intReturningMethod()</strong>;

      for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
         String s;

         try {
(3)         s = <strong>abc.stringReturningMethod()</strong>;
         }
         catch (SomeCheckedException e) {
            // somehow handle the exception
         }

         // do some other stuff
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   A possible test for the <code>doSomething()</code> method could exercise the case where
   <code>SomeCheckedException</code> gets thrown, after an arbitrary number of successful iterations.
   Assuming that we want (for whatever reasons) to record a <em>complete</em> set of expectations for the interaction
   between these two classes, we might write the test below.
   (Often, it's not desirable or important to specify <em>all</em> invocations to mocked methods and - specially -
   mocked constructors in a given test. We will address this issue later.)
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void doSomethingHandlesSomeCheckedException() throws Exception
   {
      new Expectations() {
         DependencyAbc abc;

         {
(1)         <strong>new DependencyAbc()</strong>;

(2)         abc.intReturningMethod(); <strong><em>result</em> = 3</strong>;

(3)         abc.stringReturningMethod();
            <strong>returns("str1", "str2")</strong>;
            <strong><em>result</em> = new SomeCheckedException()</strong>;
         }
      };

      new UnitUnderTest().doSomething();
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   This test records three different expectations.
   The first one, represented by the call to the <code>DependencyAbc()</code> constructor, merely accounts for the fact
   that this dependency happens to be instantiated in the code under test through the no-args constructor; no result
   needs to be specified for such an invocation, except for the occasional exception/error to be thrown (constructors
   have <code>void</code> return type, so it makes no sense to record return values for them).
   The second expectation specifies that <code>intReturningMethod()</code> will return <code>3</code> when called.
   The third one specifies a sequence of three consecutive results for <code>stringReturningMethod()</code>, where the
   last result happens to be an instance of the desired exception, allowing the test to achieve its goal (note that it
   will only pass if the exception is not propagated out).

   </div>
</h3>
<p>
   Previously, we explained that an expectation recorded on a mocked instance, such as
   <code><strong>abc</strong>.intReturningMethod(); <em>result</em> = 3;</code> would actually match invocations to
   <code>DependencyAbc#intReturningMethod()</code> on <em>any</em> instance of the mocked <code>DependencyAbc</code>
   class.
   In most cases, tested code uses a <em>single</em> instance of a given dependency, so this won't really matter and can
   be safely ignored, whether the mocked instance is <em>passed into</em> tested code or <em>created inside</em> it.
   But what if we need to verify that invocations occur on a <em>specific</em> instance, between the several/many ones
   that happen to be used by code under test?
   JMockit actually provides a few different ways to constrain the matching of expectations on specific mocked
   instances, as we shall see.
</p>

<h4 id="onInstance">The <code>onInstance(m)</code> constraint</h4>
<p>
   We can use the <code>Expectations#onInstance(mockObject)</code> method when recording an expectation, as the next
   example shows.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void matchOnMockInstance(final Collaborator <strong>mock</strong>)
   {
      new Expectations() {{
         <strong>onInstance(mock)</strong>.getValue(); <em>result</em> = 12;
      }};

      // Exercise unit under test with mocked instance passed from the test:
      int result = <strong>mock</strong>.getValue();
      assertEquals(12, result);

      // If another instance is created inside code under test...
      Collaborator another = new Collaborator();

      // ...we won't get the recorded result, but the default one:
      assertEquals(0, another.getValue());
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   The test above will only pass if the unit under test (here embedded in the test method itself, for brevity)
   invokes <code>getValue()</code> on the exact same instance on which the recording invocation was made.
   This is typically useful when the unit under test makes calls on two or more different instances of the same type,
   and the test wants to verify that each invocation occurred on the proper instance.
</p>
<p>
   To avoid the need to use <code>onInstance(m)</code> on every expectation when testing code which uses multiple
   instances of the same type in different ways, JMockit automatically infers the need for "onInstance" matching based
   on the set of mocked types in scope.
   Specifically, whenever two or more mock fields/parameters of the exact same type are in scope for a given test,
   invocations to instance methods made on their (automatically) assigned instances will always match expectations
   recorded on those same instances.
   Therefore, in such common situations it isn't necessary to explicitly use the <code>onInstance(m)</code> method.
</p>

<h4 id="injectable">Injectable mocked instances</h4>
<p>
   Suppose we need to test code which works with multiple instances of a given class.
   If we declare said class to be mocked, then all of its instances will be equally affected: they all become mocked
   instances, so that any instance method invoked on them gets handled according to our mocking specifications.
   However, what if we need <em>only one</em> (or a few) of those instances to be mocked, while invocations made on
   other instances continue to execute the original, "real" implementation?
   This is where the <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> annotation can help.
   (It has other uses too, which we'll address later.)
</p>
<p>
   By simply declaring a mock field or mock parameter as <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>, we get an
   "exclusive" mocked instance; any other instance of the same mocked type, unless associated with a separate mock
   field/parameter, will remain as a regular, non-mocked instance.
   Since an injectable mocked instance is used to preserve the original implementation on other instances, it follows
   that <code>static</code> methods and constructors are <em>also</em> excluded from being mocked.
   After all, a <code>static</code> method is not associated with any instance of the class, while a constructor is
   only associated with a newly created (and therefore different) instance.
</p>
<p>
   For an example, lets say we have the following class to be tested.
</p>
<pre><code>public static final class ConcatenatingInputStream extends InputStream
{
   private final Queue&lt;InputStream> sequentialInputs;
   private InputStream currentInput;

   public ConcatenatingInputStream(InputStream... sequentialInputs)
   {
      this.sequentialInputs = new LinkedList&lt;InputStream>(Arrays.asList(sequentialInputs));
      currentInput = this.sequentialInputs.poll();
   }

   @Override
   public int read() throws IOException
   {
      if (currentInput == null) return -1;

      int nextByte = currentInput.read();

      if (nextByte >= 0) {
         return nextByte;
      }

      currentInput = sequentialInputs.poll();
      return read();
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   This class could easily be tested without mocking by using <code>ByteArrayInputStream</code> objects for input, but
   lets say we want to make sure that the <code>InputStream#read()</code> method is properly invoked on each input
   stream passed in the constructor.
   The following test will achieve this.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void concatenateInputStreams(
      @Injectable final InputStream input1, @Injectable final InputStream input2)
      throws Exception
   {
      new Expectations() {{
         input1.read(); returns(1, 2, -1);
         input2.read(); returns(3, -1);
      }};

      InputStream concatenatedInput = new ConcatenatingInputStream(input1, input2);
      byte[] buf = new byte[3];
      concatenatedInput.read(buf);

      assertArrayEquals(new byte[] {1, 2, 3}, buf);
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   Note that the use of <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code> is indeed necessary here, since the class under test
   extends the mocked class, and the method called to exercise the former is defined in the latter.
   If <code>InputStream</code> was mocked "normally", the <code>read(byte[])</code> method would always be mocked,
   regardless of the instance on which it is called.
   (Well, we could still write a test without injectable instances if <em>only</em> the overriding <code>read()</code>
   method was called by the test.)
</p>

<h3 id="argumentMatching">
   Flexible matching of argument values
   <div class="navigation">
      <a href="../tutorial.html"><img align="right" src="go-home.png" title="Contents"></a>
      <a href="#mocked"><img align="right" src="go-top.png" title="First section"></a>

      <a href="#constraints"><img align="right" src="go-down.png" title="Next section"></a>
   </div>
</h3>
<p>
   In both the <em>record</em> and <em>verify</em> phases, an invocation to a mocked method or constructor identifies an
   expectation.
   If the method/constructor has one or more parameters, then a recorded/verified expectation like
   <code>doSomething(1, "s", true);</code> will only match an invocation in the <em>replay</em> phase if it has
   <em>equal</em> argument values.
   For arguments that are regular objects (not primitives or arrays), the <code>equals(Object)</code> method is used for
   equality checking.
   For parameters of array type, equality checking extends to individual elements; therefore, two different array
   instances having the same length in each dimension and equal corresponding elements are considered to be equal.
</p>
<p>
   In a given test, we often don't know exactly what those argument values will be, or they simply aren't essential for
   what is being tested.
   So, to allow a recorded or verified invocation to match a whole set of replayed invocations with different argument
   values, we can specify flexible <em>argument matching constraints</em> instead of actual argument values.
   This is done by using <code>withXyz(...)</code> methods and/or <code>anyXyz</code> <em>fields</em>.
   The "with" methods and "any" fields are all defined in the <code class="type">mockit.Invocations</code> base class,
   which both <code class="type">mockit.Expectations</code> and <code class="type">mockit.Verifications</code> extend.
   Therefore, they can be used in expectation as well as verification blocks.
</p>

<h4 id="withMethods">Using the "with" methods for argument matching</h4>
<p>
   When recording or verifying an expectation, calls to the <code>withXyz(...)</code> methods can occur for any subset
   of the arguments passed in the invocation.
   They can be freely mixed with regular argument-passing (using literal values, local variables, etc.).
   The only requirement is that such calls appear inside the recorded/verified invocation statement, rather than before
   it.
   It's not possible, for example, to first assign the result of a call to <code>withNotEqual(val)</code> to a local
   variable and then use the variable in the invocation statement.
   An example test using some of the "with" methods is shown below.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void someTestMethod(@NonStrict final DependencyAbc abc)
   {
      final DataItem item = new DataItem(...);

      new Expectations() {{
         // Will match "voidMethod(String, List)" invocations with the first argument
         // equal to "str" and the second not null.
         abc.voidMethod(<strong>"str", (List&lt;?>) withNotNull()</strong>);

         // Will match invocations to DependencyAbc#stringReturningMethod(DataItem, String)
         // with the first argument pointing to "item" and the second one containing "xyz".
         abc.stringReturningMethod(<strong>withSameInstance(item), withSubstring("xyz")</strong>);
      }};

      new UnitUnderTest().doSomething(item);

      new Verifications() {{
         // Matches invocations to the specified method with any long-valued argument.
         abc.anotherVoidMethod(<strong>withAny(1L)</strong>);
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   There are more "with" methods than shown above.
   See the <a href="../javadoc/mockit/Expectations.html#withEqual(T)">API documentation</a> for more details.
</p>
<p>
   Besides the several predefined argument matching constraints available in the API, JMockit allows the user to provide
   custom constraints, through the <code>&lt;T> T with(Object)</code> and <code>&lt;T> T with(T, Object>)</code> generic
   methods.
   The parameter of type <code class="type">Object</code> can be an <code class="type">org.hamcrest.Matcher</code>
   object from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hamcrest">Hamcrest</a> library, or a suitable handler object
   (see the <a href="../javadoc/mockit/Expectations.html#with(T, java.lang.Object)">API documentation</a> for details).
</p>

<h4 id="matcherFields">Using the "any" <em>fields</em> for argument matching</h4>
<p>
   The most common argument matching constraint tends also to be the <em>least</em> restrictive one: to match
   invocations with <em>any</em> value for a given parameter (of the proper parameter type, of course).
   For such cases we have a whole set of special <em>argument matching fields</em>, one for each primitive type (and the
   corresponding wrapper class), one for strings, and a "universal" one of type <code>Object</code>.
   The test below demonstrates some uses.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void someTestMethod(@NonStrict final DependencyAbc abc)
   {
      final DataItem item = new DataItem(...);

      new Expectations() {{
         // Will match "voidMethod(String, List)" invocations where the first argument is
         // any string and the second any list.
         abc.voidMethod(<strong><em>anyString</em>, (List&lt;?>) <em>any</em></strong>);
      }};

      new UnitUnderTest().doSomething(item);

      new Verifications() {{
         // Matches invocations to the specified method with any value of type long or Long.
         abc.anotherVoidMethod(<strong><em>anyLong</em></strong>);
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   The same requirement of having calls to "with" methods inside the invocation statement applies in the case of
   accesses to "any" fields: they must appear at the actual argument positions in the invocation statement, not before.
   Again, see the <a href="../javadoc/mockit/Expectations.html#anyInt">API documentation</a> for
   more details on argument matching fields.
</p>

<h4 id="nullAsMatcher">Using the <code>null</code> value to match any object reference</h4>
<p>
   When using at least one argument matching method or field for a given expectation, we can use a "shortcut" to specify
   that any object reference should be accepted (for a parameter of reference type).
   Simply pass the <code>null</code> value instead of a <code>withAny(x)</code> or <code>any</code> argument matcher.
   In particular, this avoids the need to cast the value to the declared parameter type.
   However, bear in mind that this behavior is only applicable when <em>at least one</em> explicit argument matcher
   (either a "with" method or an "any" field) is used for the expectation.
   When passed in an invocation that uses no matchers, the <code>null</code> value will match only the <code>null</code>
   reference.
   In the previous test, we could therefore have written:
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void someTestMethod(@NonStrict final DependencyAbc abc)
   {
      ...

      new Expectations() {{
         abc.voidMethod(<em>anyString</em>, <strong>null</strong>);
      }};

      ...
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   When one or more argument matchers are used and the <code>null</code> reference must be matched for a given
   parameter, the <code>withNull()</code> method should be used.
</p>
<p>
   In conclusion, there are two <em>modes</em> for argument matching: the basic one where no matching constraints are
   specified and all arguments must be equal, and the one where matching constraints are specified for some or all
   parameters.
   The meaning of the <code>null</code> value is different for each mode, which may lead to confusion at times.
   For complex invocations where multiple arguments are involved, though, the benefits of being able to use "any" fields
   and the <code>null</code> reference should outweigh the additional API complexity.
</p>

<h4 id="varargs">Matching values passed through a <em>varargs</em> parameter</h4>
<p>
   Occasionally we may need to deal with expectations for "varargs" methods or constructors.
   It's valid to pass regular values as a varargs argument, and <em>also</em> valid to use the "with"/"any" matchers
   for such values.
   However, it's <em>not</em> valid to combine both kinds of value-passing for the same expectation, when targeting a
   varargs parameter.
   We need to either use <em>only</em> regular values or <em>only</em> values obtained through argument matchers.
</p>
<p>
   In case we want to match invocations where the varargs parameter receives any number of values (including zero),
   we can specify an expectation with the <strong><code>(Object[]) any</code></strong> constraint for the final varargs
   parameter.
</p>
<p>
   Probably the best way to understand the exact semantics of varargs matching (since there is no specific API involved)
   is to look at or experiment with actual tests.
   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/source/browse/trunk/main/test/mockit/ExpectationsWithVarArgsMatchersTest.java">This</a>
   test class demonstrates virtually all possibilities.

</h3>
<p>
   So far, we saw that besides an associated method or constructor, an expectation can have invocation results and
   argument matchers.
   Given that the unit under test can call the same method or constructor multiple times with different or identical
   arguments, we need a way to account for all those separate invocations.
   One way, as already seen, is to simply record one separate expectation for each expected invocation, in the same
   order as the invocations should be replayed; another is to record two or more consecutive results for a single
   expectation.
</p>
<p>
   Yet another way is to specify an <em>invocation count constraint</em> for a given expectation.
   The mocking API provides three special fields just for that: <strong><code>times</code></strong>,
   <strong><code>minTimes</code></strong>, and <strong><code>maxTimes</code></strong>.
   These fields belong to the <code class="type">mockit.Invocations</code> class, the non-public base class for
   both <code class="type">mockit.Expectations</code> and <code class="type">mockit.Verifications</code>.
   Therefore, an invocation count constraint can be specified either when recording or when verifying expectations.
   In either case, the method or constructor associated with the expectation will be constrained to receive a number of
   invocations that falls in the specified range.
   Any invocations less or more than the expected lower or upper limit, respectively, and the test
   execution will automatically fail.
   Lets see some example tests.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void someTestMethod(final DependencyAbc abc)
   {
      new Expectations() {{
         // By default, one invocation is expected, i.e. "times = 1":
         new DependencyAbc();

         // At least two invocations are expected:
         abc.voidMethod(); <strong><em>minTimes</em> = 2;</strong>

         // 1 to 5 invocations are expected:
         abc.stringReturningMethod(); <strong><em>minTimes</em> = 1; <em>maxTimes</em> = 5;</strong>
      }};

      new UnitUnderTest().doSomething();
   }

   @Test
   public void someOtherTestMethod(final DependencyAbc abc)
   {
      new UnitUnderTest().doSomething();

      new Verifications() {{
         // Verifies that zero or one invocations occurred, with the specified argument value:
         abc.anotherVoidMethod(3); <strong><em>maxTimes</em> = 1;</strong>

         // Verifies the occurrence of at least one invocation with the specified arguments:
         DependencyAbc.someStaticMethod("test", false); // "minTimes = 1" is implied
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   Unlike the <code>result</code> field, each of these three fields can be specified at most once for a given
   expectation.
   Any non-negative integer value is valid for any of the invocation count constraints.
   If <code><em>times</em> = <strong>0</strong></code> or <code><em>maxTimes</em> = <strong>0</strong></code> is
   specified, the first invocation matching the expectation to occur during replay (if any) will cause the test to fail.

<p>
   Expectations recorded inside a <code>new Expectations() {...}</code> block are all <em>strict</em> by default, unless
   specified otherwise.
   What this means is that the invocations they specify are <em>expected</em> to occur during the <em>replay</em> phase,
   and in the <em>same</em> order as they were recorded;
   additionally, <em>only</em> these invocations are allowed to occur.
   Any <em>unexpected</em> invocations that were not recorded will automatically cause the test to fail.
</p>
<p>
   On the other hand, when we want to record <em>non-strict</em> (or <em>loose</em>) expectations, the
   <code class="type">mockit.NonStrictExpectations</code> subclass can be used.
   Inside a non-strict expectation block, all invocations to mocked types will be <em>allowed</em> to occur during the
   replay phase, not <em>expected</em>.
   That is, by default they may or may not occur during replay without causing the test to fail on their own.
   Also, they don't have to occur in the same order as they were recorded.
</p>
<p>
   By default, a strict expectation will match exactly one invocation in the replay phase.
   That is, the expectation will have an implicit invocation count constraint of <code>1</code>, as if it was followed
   by a <code><em>times</em> = 1</code> constraint.
   An expectation recorded as non-strict, on the other hand, will by default be allowed to match any number of
   invocations in the replay phase.
   That is, its implicit invocation count constraint will have a lower limit of <code>0</code> and an unbounded upper
   limit, as if specified as <code>minTimes = 0</code>.
   In either case, however, the implicit invocation count constraint can be overridden by an explicit one (that is, an
   explicit assignment to one of the <code>times/minTimes/maxTimes</code> fields).
   So, a strict expectation can be made to allow an arbitrary number of invocations, while a non-strict one can be made
   to disallow unexpected invocations, when needed.
</p>
<p>
   Note that in the case of strict expectations, all matching invocations occurring during replay are
   <em>implicitly</em> verified.
   The remaining invocations will be considered unexpected (and fail the test), unless the associated mocked type is not
   strict.
   So, the use of strict expectations which are verified implicitly precludes the use of verification blocks, which are
   used for explicit verification of invocations.
   In fact, inside a <code>new Verifications() {...}</code> block only invocations matching recorded non-strict
   expectations are permitted, as well as invocations to non-strict mocked types for which no expectation was explicitly
   recorded.
</p>
<p>
   To allow mixing strict and non-strict expectations inside a <code>new Expectations() {...}</code> block, we can apply
   the <code class="type">mockit.NonStrict</code> annotation to a mock field or parameter.
   Any invocation to such a mocked type will be considered as belonging to a non-strict expectation, and all unrecorded
   invocations in the replay phase will be allowed (that is, they will never be considered as unexpected, and therefore
   will not cause the test to fail).
   This is particularly useful to avoid the need to record invocations to constructors, or to any uninteresting methods.
</p>
<p>
   So, how do we choose between strict and non-strict expectations for a given test?
   There is really no general-purpose answer to this question.
   It will depend on the particulars of the unit under test, and on personal preferences.
   Also, keep in mind that a test can mix both kinds of expectations, so there is a lot of flexibility in using them.
</p>

<h4 id="strictMocks">Strict and non-strict <em>mocks</em></h4>
<p>
   To recapitulate, we can specify the lack of strictness in two different ways:
   1) that all expectations for a particular mocked type/instance should be non-strict, by annotating the mock field or
   parameter with <code class="annotation">@NonStrict</code>;
   and 2) that all expectations recorded should be non-strict, by using the
   <code class="type">NonStrictExpectations</code> class.
</p>
<p>
   On the other hand, there is no explicit way to specify that a given mocked type/instance, or a whole expectation
   block should be <em>strict</em>.
   Recorded expectations are considered strict <em>by default</em>, when we do <em>not</em> specify that they should be
   non-strict.
   So, for an expectation to be strict, it needs to be recorded inside an expectation block not derived from
   <code class="type">NonStrictExpectations</code>, for a mocked type not annotated as
   <code class="annotation">@NonStrict</code>.
   The associated mocked type and its instances will then be considered to be strictly verified as a whole.
</p>
<p>
   Finally, note that when <em>no</em> expectations are recorded in a test for a given mocked type, it is automatically
   assumed to be fully non-strict (as if the mock field/parameter was annotated as
   <code class="annotation">@NonStrict</code>).
</p>

<h4 id="iteratedExpectations">Iterated expectations</h4>
<p>
   When a sequence of consecutive invocations is recorded with strict expectations (the relative order between
   invocations is irrelevant with <em>non-strict</em> expectations), the whole sequence is expected to occur exactly
   <em>once</em> during the replay phase.
   Consider, however, the case where the tested code executes those invocations in a loop (or any kind of iteration).
   Assuming that the number of iterations is known in the test, we can still record those expectations with a single
   invocation to each method/constructor called inside the loop (that is, without writing a loop or repeating the
   expectations inside the expectation block).
   The next test demonstrates this feature, using the <code>Expectations(int numberOfIterations)</code> constructor.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void recordStrictInvocationsInIteratingBlock(final Collaborator mock)
   {
      new <strong>Expectations(2)</strong> {{
         mock.setSomething(<em>anyInt</em>);
         mock.save();
      }};

      // In the tested code:
      mock.setSomething(123);
      mock.save();
      mock.setSomething(45);
      mock.save();
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   This ability to specify the number of iterations for a group of invocations also applies to non-strict expectations.
   However, in this case the specified number of iterations is merely used as a <em>multiplier</em> for the upper and
   lower limits of invocation count constraints (both implicit and explicit ones).
   Non-strict expectations with no specified invocation count constraint, therefore, are not affected.
</p>

<p>
   Strict expectations are verified implicitly, so there is no point in re-verifying them in a explicit verification
   block.
   Non-strict expectations, on the other hand, are usually verified through explicit invocations to mocked types in a
   verification block.
   As will be seen later, a recorded non-strict expectation can still be verified implicitly, without the need to write
   an invocation inside a verification block.
</p>
<p>
   Inside a <code>new Verifications() {...}</code> block we can use the same API that's available in a
   <code>new NonStrictExpectations() {...}</code> block, with the exception of the methods and fields used to record
   return values and thrown exceptions/errors.
   That is, we can freely use the <code>anyXyz</code> fields, the <code>withXyz(...)</code> argument matching methods,
   and the <code>times</code>, <code>minTimes</code>, and <code>maxTimes</code> invocation count constraint fields.
   An example test follows.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void verifyInvocationsExplicitlyAtEndOfTest(final Dependency mock)
   {
      // Nothing recorded here, but it could be.

      // Inside tested code:
      Dependency dependency = new Dependency();
      dependency.doSomething(123, true, "abc-xyz");

      // Verifies that Dependency#doSomething(int, boolean, String) was called at least once,
      // with arguments that obey the specified constraints:
      <strong>new Verifications() {{ mock.doSomething(<em>anyInt</em>, true, withPrefix("abc")); }};</strong>
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   Note that, by default, a verification checks that <em>at least one</em> matching invocation occurred during replay.
   When we need to verify an exact number of invocations (including <code>1</code>), the <code>times = n</code>
   constraint must be specified.
</p>

<h4 id="importingMocks">Importing mocks from expectation blocks</h4>
<p>
   Mocked instances and mocked types declared as mock fields of the test class or as mock parameters of the test method
   are immediately available inside verification blocks.
   However, expectation blocks can also declare <em>local</em> mock fields, which won't be accessible outside the block.
   In such cases, it's possible to <em>import</em> those mocked instances into a verification block, as the next example
   shows.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void importLocalMockFromPreviousNonStrictExpectationsBlock()
   {
      new NonStrictExpectations() {
         <strong>Dependency mock;</strong>

         {
            mock.notifyBeforeSave(); <em>result</em> = true;
         }
      };

      // Inside tested code:
      Dependency dependency = new Dependency();
      dependency.editABunchMoreStuff();

      new Verifications() {
         <strong>Dependency mock;</strong>

         {
            mock.editABunchMoreStuff();
         }
      };
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   The mocked types to be imported are identified by the <em>types</em> of the fields declared in the verification,
   not by the field names. Typically, though, the same field names will be used to avoid confusion.
   This ability can be useful if for whatever reason mock parameters are not desired, or when
   capturing internally created instances of mocked types (explained in a later section).
</p>

<h4 id="neverHappened">Verifying that an invocation never happened</h4>
<p>
   To do this inside a verification block, add a <code>times = 0</code> assignment right after the
   invocation that is expected to not have happened during the replay phase.
   If one or more matching invocations did happen, the test will fail.
</p>

<h4 id="VerificationInOrder">Verification in order</h4>
<p>
   Regular verification blocks, like the one below, are <em>unordered</em>.
   The actual relative order in which <code>aMethod()</code> and <code>anotherMethod()</code> were called during the
   replay phase is not verified, but only that each method was executed at least once.
   If you want to verify the relative order of invocations, then a
   <code>new <strong>VerificationsInOrder</strong>() {...}</code> block must be used instead.
   Inside this block, simply write invocations to one or more mocked types in the order they are expected to have
   occurred.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void verifyingExpectationsInOrder(final DependencyAbc abc)
   {
      // Somewhere inside the tested code:
      abc.aMethod();
      abc.doSomething("blah", 123);
      abc.anotherMethod(5);
      ...

      new <strong>VerificationsInOrder</strong>() {{
         // The order of these invocations must be the same as the order
         // of occurrence during replay of the matching invocations.
         <strong>abc.aMethod();
         abc.anotherMethod(<em>anyInt</em>);</strong>
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   Note that the call <code>abc.doSomething(...)</code> was <em>not</em> verified in the test, so it could have occurred
   at any time (or not at all).
</p>

<h4 id="partiallyOrdered">Partially ordered verification</h4>
<p>
   Suppose you want to verify that a particular method (or constructor) was called <em>before</em>/<em>after</em> other
   invocations, but you don't care about the order in which those other invocations occurred.
   Inside an ordered verification block, this can be achieved by simply calling the
   <a href="../javadoc/mockit/VerificationsInOrder.html#unverifiedInvocations()">unverifiedInvocations()</a>
   method at the appropriate place(s).
   The following test demonstrates it.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Mocked DependencyAbc abc;
   @Mocked AnotherDependency xyz;

   @Test
   public void verifyingTheOrderOfSomeExpectationsRelativeToAllOthers()
   {
      new UnitUnderTest().doSomething();

      new VerificationsInOrder() {{
         abc.methodThatNeedsToExecuteFirst();
         <strong>unverifiedInvocations();</strong> // Invocations not verified must come here...
         xyz.method1();
         abc.method2();
         <strong>unverifiedInvocations();</strong> // ... and/or here.
         xyz.methodThatNeedsToExecuteLast();
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   The example above is actually quite sophisticated, as it verifies several things:
   a) a method that must be called <em>before</em> others; b) a method that must be called <em>after</em> others;
   and c) that <code>AnotherDependency#method1()</code> must be called just before <code>DependencyAbc#method2()</code>.
   In most tests, we will probably only do one of these different kinds of order-related verifications.
   But the power is there to make all kinds of complex verifications quite easily.
</p>
<p>
   Another situation not covered by the examples above is one where we want to verify that certain invocations occurred
   in a given relative order, while also verifying the other invocations (in any order).
   For this, we need to write two separate verification blocks, as illustrated below (where <code>mock</code> is a mock
   field of the test class).
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void verifyFirstAndLastCallsWithOthersInBetweenInAnyOrder()
   {
      // Invocations that occur while exercising the code under test:
      mock.prepare();
      mock.setSomethingElse("anotherValue");
      mock.setSomething(123);
      mock.notifyBeforeSave();
      mock.save();

      new VerificationsInOrder() {{
         mock.prepare(); // first expected call
         <strong>unverifiedInvocations();</strong> // others at this point
         mock.notifyBeforeSave(); // just before last
         mock.save(); <em>times</em> = 1; // last expected call
      }};

      // Unordered verification of the invocations previously left unverified.
      // Could be ordered, but then it would be simpler to just include these invocations
      // in the previous block, in the place of the "unverifiedInvocations()".
      new Verifications() {{
         mock.setSomething(123);
         mock.setSomethingElse(<em>anyString</em>);
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   Usually, when a test has multiple verification blocks their relative order of execution <em>is</em> important.
   In the previous test, for example, if the unordered block came before it would have left no "unverified invocations"
   to match a later call to <code>unverifiedInvocations()</code>;
   the test would still pass (assuming it originally passed) since it's not required that unverified invocations
   actually occurred at the called position, but it would <em>not</em> have verified that the unordered group of
   invocations occurred between the first and last expected calls.
</p>

<h4 id="FullVerification">Full verification</h4>
<p>
   Sometimes it may be important to have <em>all</em> invocations to the mocked types involved in a test verified.
   This is automatically the case when recording strict expectations, since any unexpected invocation causes the test to
   fail.
   When non-strict expectations are explicitly verified, though, a <code>new FullVerifications() {...}</code> block can
   be used to make sure that no invocations are left unverified.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void verifyAllInvocations(final Dependency mock)
   {
      // Code under test included here for easy reference:
      mock.setSomething(123);
      mock.setSomethingElse("anotherValue");
      mock.setSomething(45);
      mock.save();

      <strong>new FullVerifications()</strong> {{
         // Verifications here are unordered, so the following invocations could be in any order.
         mock.setSomething(<em>anyInt</em>); // verifies two actual invocations
         mock.setSomethingElse(<em>anyString</em>);
         mock.save(); // if this verification (or any other above) is removed the test will fail
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   Note that if a lower limit (a minimum invocation count constraint) is specified for an otherwise non-strict
   expectation, then this constraint will always be implicitly verified at the end of the test.
   Therefore, explicitly verifying such an expectation inside the full verification block is not necessary.
</p>

<h4 id="FullVerificationInOrder">Full verification in order</h4>
<p>
   So, we have seen how to do <em>unordered</em> verifications with <code class="type">Verifications</code>,
   <em>ordered</em> verifications with <code class="type">VerificationsInOrder</code>, and full verifications with
   <code class="type">FullVerifications</code>.
   But what about <em>full ordered</em> verifications? Easy enough:
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void verifyAllInvocationsInOrder(final Dependency mock)
   {
      // Code under test included here for easy reference:
      mock.setSomething(123);
      mock.setSomethingElse("anotherValue");
      mock.setSomething(45);
      mock.save();

      <strong>new FullVerificationsInOrder()</strong> {{
         mock.setSomething(<em>anyInt</em>);
         mock.setSomethingElse(<em>anyString</em>);
         mock.setSomething(<em>anyInt</em>);
         mock.save();
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   Notice there is a not so obvious difference in semantics, though.
   In the <code>verifyAllInvocations</code> test above, we were able to match two separate
   <code>mock.setSomething(...)</code> invocations with a single invocation in the verification block.
   In the <code>verifyAllInvocationsInOrder</code> test, however, we had to write two separate invocations to that
   method inside the block, in the proper order with respect to other invocations.
</p>
<p>
   You may now be thinking that writing a <code class="type">FullVerificationsInOrder</code> block ends up being the
   same as writing an <code class="type">Expectations</code> block where all expectations are strict.
   So, have we come full circle? Almost, but not quite.
   For non-strict expectations, the default invocation count constraint corresponds to a
   <code><em>minTimes</em> = 1</code> assignment, which leaves room for multiple invocations to the same method or
   constructor in the replay phase.
   So, in the above test for example, if the <code>setSomethingElse(...)</code> method was invoked a second time during
   the replay phase, the test would still pass (provided the second invocation occurred in the expected order, as
   specified inside the verification block).
</p>

<h4 id="restrictedFullVerifications">Restricting the set of mocked types to be fully verified</h4>
<p>
   By default, <em>all</em> invocations to <em>all</em> mocked instances/types in effect for a given test must be
   verified explicitly when using a <code>new FullVerifications() {}</code> or
   <code>new FullVerificationsInOrder() {}</code> block.
   Now, what if we have a test with two (or more) mocked types but we only want to fully verify invocations to one of
   them (or to any subset of mocked types when more than two)?
   The answer is to use the <strong><code>FullVerifications(Object... mockedTypesAndInstancesToVerify)</code></strong>
   constructor, where only the given mocked instances and mocked types (ie, class objects/literals) are considered.
   The following test provides an example.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void verifyAllInvocationsToOnlyOneOfTwoMockedTypes(Dependency mock1, AnotherDependency mock2)
   {
      // Inside code under test:
      mock1.prepare();
      mock1.setSomething(123);
      <strong>mock2</strong>.doSomething();
      mock1.editABunchMoreStuff();
      mock1.save();

      new FullVerifications(mock1) {{
         mock1.prepare();
         mock1.setSomething(<em>anyInt</em>);
         mock1.editABunchMoreStuff();
         mock1.save(); <em>times</em> = 1;
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   In the test above, the <code>mock2.doSomething()</code> invocation is never verified.
   It's possible to restrict verification only to the methods (and constructors) of a single class,
   by passing its class literal in the <code>FullVerifications(...)</code> or <code>FullVerificationsInOrder(...)</code>
   constructor.
   For example, the <code>new FullVerificationsInOrder(AnotherDependency.class) { ... }</code> block would only make
   sure that all invocations to the mocked <code class="type">AnotherDependency</code> class were verified.
</p>

<h4 id="emptyFullVerifications">Verifying that no invocations occurred</h4>
<p>
   To verify that <em>no</em> invocations at all occurred on the non-strict mocked types/instances used in a test, add
   an <em>empty</em> full verification block to it.
   As always, note that any expectations that were <em>recorded</em> as expected through an specified
   <code>times/minTimes</code> constraint are verified implicitly and therefore disregarded by the full verification
   block; in such a case the empty verification block will verify that no <em>other</em> invocations occurred.
   Additionally, if any expectations were verified in a <em>previous</em> verification block in the same test, they are
   also disregarded by the full verification block.
</p>
<p>
   If the test uses two or more mocked types/instances and you want to verify that no invocations occurred for some of
   them, specify the desired mocked types and/or instances in the constructor to the empty verification block.
   An example test follows.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void verifyNoInvocationsOnOneOfTwoMockedDependenciesBeyondThoseRecordedAsExpected(
      final Dependency mock1, final AnotherDependency mock2)
   {
      new NonStrictExpectations() {{
         // These two are recorded as expected:
         mock1.setSomething(<em>anyInt</em>); <em>minTimes</em> = 1;
         mock2.doSomething(); <em>times</em> = 1;
      }};

      // Inside code under test:
      mock1.prepare();
      mock1.setSomething(1);
      mock1.setSomething(2);
      mock1.save();
      mock2.doSomething();

      // Will verify that no invocations other than to "doSomething()" occurred on mock2:
      <strong>new FullVerifications(mock2) {};</strong>
   }

</code></pre>

<h4 id="unspecifiedInvocations">Verifying unspecified invocations that should not happen</h4>
<p>
   A full verification block (ordered or not) also allows us to verify that certain methods and/or constructors never
   get invoked, without having to specify each one of them with a corresponding <code><em>times</em> = 0</code>
   assignment.
   The following test provides an example.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void readOnlyOperation(final Dependency mock)
   {
      new NonStrictExpectations() {{
         mock.getData(); <em>result</em> = "test data";
      }};

      // Code under test:
      String data = mock.getData();
      // <strong>mock.save() should not be called here</strong>
      ...

      <strong>new FullVerifications()</strong> {{
         mock.getData(); <strong><em>minTimes</em> = 0; // calls to getData are allowed</strong>
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   If a call to any method (or constructor) of the <code>Dependency</code> class occurs during the replay phase, except
   for the ones explicitly verified in the verification block (<code>Dependency#getData()</code> in this case), then the
   test above will fail.
   On the other hand, it may be easier to use strict expectations in such cases, without any verification block at all.
</p>

<h4 id="iterations">Verifying iterations</h4>
<p>
   There is one last thing about verification blocks we need to examine: the ability to easily verify invocations that
   occur inside loops, for an specified number of iterations of the loop.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void verifyAllInvocations(final Dependency mock)
   {
      int numberOfIterations = 3;

      // Code under test included here for easy reference:
      for (int i = 0; i < numberOfIterations; i++) {
         DataItem data = getData(i);
         mock.setData(data);
         mock.save();
      }

      <strong>new Verifications(numberOfIterations)</strong> {{
         mock.setData((DataItem) withNotNull());
         mock.save();
      }};

      <strong>new VerificationsInOrder(numberOfIterations)</strong> {{
         mock.setData((DataItem) withNotNull());
         mock.save();
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   The use of two verification blocks above is just to explain the different semantics between ordered and unordered
   iterating verification blocks.
   In the first block, each verified invocation will have to match at least three invocations to the same method in the
   replay phase, because this was the number of iterations passed in the constructor.
   For an unordered iterating block, the specified number of iterations is effectively multiplied by the lower and upper
   invocation count limits; this happens even if an explicit constraint is specified inside the block, such as a
   <code><em>minTimes</em> = 1; <em>maxTimes</em> = 4;</code> pair of assignments, which in this particular example
   would be turned into <code><em>minTimes</em> = 3; <em>maxTimes</em> = 12;</code>.
   In the second block, on the other hand, invocation count constraints are not affected.
   Instead, the resulting effect is equivalent to "unrolling the loop", as if the whole sequence of verified invocations
   inside the block was duplicated for each iteration.
</p>
<p>
   The semantics for an iterating <code class="type">FullVerifications</code> block is the same as for a regular
   <code class="type">Verifications</code> block.
   The same applies for an iterating <code class="type">FullVerificationsInOrder</code> block, with respect to a

   We have seen how to record results for invocations through assignments to the <code><em>result</em></code> field or
   calls to the <code>returns(...)</code> method.
   We have also seen how to match invocation arguments flexibly with the <code>withXyz(...)</code> group of methods and
   the various <code><em>anyXyz</em></code> fields.
   But what if a test needs to decide the result of a recorded invocation based on the arguments it will receive at
   replay time?
   We can do it through a <code class="type">mockit.Delegate</code> instance, as exemplified below.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void someTestMethod()
   {
      new Expectations() {
         @NonStrict DependencyAbc abc;

         {
            abc.intReturningMethod(<em>anyInt</em>, null);
            <em>result</em> = <strong>new Delegate() {
               int aDelegateMethod(int i, String s)
               {
                  return i == 1 ? i : s.length();
               }
            }</strong>;
         }
      };

      new UnitUnderTest().doSomething();
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   The <code class="type">Delegate</code> interface is empty, being used simply to tell JMockit that actual invocations
   at replay time should be delegated to the "delegate" method in the assigned object.
   This method can have any name, provided it is the only one in the delegate object; otherwise, it must have the same
   name as the method for which the expectation is recorded.
   As for the parameters of the delegate method, they should either match the parameters of the recorded method, or
   there should be none.
   In any case, the delegate method is allowed to have an additional parameter of type
   <code class="type">Invocation</code> as its first parameter.
   (The <code class="type">Invocation</code> object received during replay will provide access to the invoked instance
   and the actual invocation arguments, along with other abilities.)
   The return type of a delegate method doesn't have to be the same as the recorded method, although it should be
   compatible in order to avoid a <code class="type">ClassCastException</code> later.
</p>
<p>
   Constructors can also be handled through delegate <em>methods</em>, except that such methods must be named
   "<code>$init</code>".
   The following example test shows a constructor invocation being delegated through a reusable
   <code class="type">Delegate</code> class, which saves an argument value for later verification in the test.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void anotherTestMethod()
   {
      <strong>final ConstructorDelegate delegate = new ConstructorDelegate();</strong>

      new Expectations() {
         Collaborator mock;

         {
            new Collaborator(<em>anyInt</em>); <em>result</em> = <strong>delegate</strong>;
         }
      };

      new Collaborator(4);

      assertTrue(<strong>delegate.capturedArgument</strong> > 0);
   }

   <strong>static class ConstructorDelegate implements Delegate
   {
      int capturedArgument;
      void $init(int i) { capturedArgument = i; }
   }</strong>

<p>
   <code class="type">Delegate</code> implementations can be used to validate invocation arguments, but they are limited
   to expectation blocks.
   Besides, the main point of delegate methods is to specify <em>invocation results</em> (values to return or exceptions
   to throw) at replay time, based on the arguments received.
   If the actual need is to validate the arguments passed at replay time in each invocation matching an expectation, the
   <strong><code>forEachInvocation</code></strong> field can be used instead.
   Such validations can be specified not only in expectation blocks, but also in verification blocks.
   For example, consider the following test:
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void verifyExpectationWithArgumentValidatorForEachInvocation(final Collaborator mock)
   {
      // Inside tested code:
      new Collaborator().doSomething(0.5, new int[2], "test");

      new Verifications() {{
         mock.doSomething(<em>anyDouble</em>, null, null);
         <strong><em>forEachInvocation</em> = new Object() {
            void validate(double d, int[] i, String s)
            {
               assertTrue(d > 0.0);
               assertEquals(2, i.length);
               assertTrue(s.length() > 1);
            }
         };</strong>
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   In this test, <em>each</em> and every invocation to the <code>Collaborator#doSomething</code> method that occurs
   during the replay phase and that matches the verified expectation will be validated by a call to the specified
   <strong><code>validate</code></strong> method.
   Each such call will be made with the same arguments that the verified method/constructor received at replay time.
   In this particular example, the verified expectation matches invocations with any arguments, but more strict argument
   matchers could have been used.
</p>
<p>
   Differently from <code class="type">Delegate</code> implementations, the object assigned to the
   <code>forEachInvocation</code> field can be of any type.
   The implementation class should define exactly one non-<code>private</code> method of any name, with the same number
   of parameters as the validated method/constructor or no parameters at all.
   Any number of additional <code>private</code> methods is allowed.
   The types of corresponding parameters don't have to be exactly the same, but they must be compatible in order to
   avoid the potential for <code class="type">ClassCastException</code>'s.
</p>
<p>
   Optionally, a first parameter of type <code class="type">mockit.Invocation</code> can be declared in the validation
   method.
   The semantics in this case are the same as in the case of a <code class="type">Delegate</code> method with that same
   special parameter.

<p>
   Although the use of validation methods with the <code>forEachInvocation</code> field provides all the flexibility
   one may need, it can look somewhat verbose.
   A more succinct alternative is provided by a pair of special "<code>withCapture</code>" methods, as the following
   example tests demonstrate.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void capturingArgumentsFromSingleInvocation()
   {
      // Inside tested code:
      new Collaborator().doSomething(0.5, new int[2], "test");

      new Verifications() {{
         double d;
         String s;
         mock.doSomething(d = withCapture(), null, s = withCapture());
         assertTrue(d > 0.0);
         assertTrue(s.length() > 1);
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   The <code>withCapture()</code> method can only be used in verification blocks, when a single matching invocation is
   expected to occur.
   It is particularly useful with parameters of a complex type, which may contain several items whose values need to be
   checked.
   If multiple matching invocations are expected, then the <code>withCapture(List)</code> method should be used instead:
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void capturingArgumentsFromMultipleInvocations(@Mocked final Collaborator mock)
   {
      mock.doSomething(dataObject1);
      mock.doSomething(dataObject2);

      new Verifications() {{
         List&lt;DataObject> dataObjects = new ArrayList<>();
         mock.doSomething(withCapture(dataObjects));
         assertEquals(2, dataObjects.size());
         DataObject data1 = dataObjects.get(0);
         DataObject data2 = dataObjects.get(1);
         // Perform arbitrary assertions on data1 and data2.
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   Differently from <code>withCapture()</code>, the <code>withCapture(List)</code> overload can also be used in
   expectation recording blocks.

<p>
   Normally, behavior-based tests for a given unit are written against the <code>public/protected/default</code>
   interface of the unit's dependencies.
   Sometimes, however, the method being tested may call <code>private</code> methods defined in the same class, and
   accounting for the behavior of those methods in the test may be undesirable (perhaps because it is too complex or
   simply not important for the test).
</p>
<p>
   A different situation arises when a test wants to verify not only the behavior, but also the state of the unit under
   test after it is exercised, and the relevant state is stored in non-accessible fields.
   Some tests may also need to set some necessary state in non-accessible fields of the unit under test before it is
   exercised.
</p>
<p>
   A third kind of situation would be the eventual need to instantiate non-accessible classes from a given test.
   Such a need should be rare, though.
</p>
<p>
   To handle these needs (rare though they may be) the <code class="type">Expectations</code> class provides a set of
   Reflection-based utility methods that allow a test to invoke non-accessible methods on a given object or class, to
   instantiate objects through non-accessible constructors, and to get or set the values of fields in given objects or
   classes.
   The example test below showcases some of these utility methods.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void someTestMethod()
   {
      final UnitUnderTest tested = new UnitUnderTest();

      new Expectations() {
         @NonStrict DependencyAbc abc;

         {
            // Defines some necessary state on the unit under test:
            <strong>setField(tested, "someIntField", 123);</strong>

            // Expectations recorded (even if the invocations are done through Reflection):
            <strong>newInstance("some.package.AnotherDependency", true, "test");</strong> <em>maxTimes</em> = 1;
            <strong>invoke(tested, "intReturningMethod", 45, "");</strong> <em>result</em> = 1;
            // other expectations recorded...
         }
      };

      tested.doSomething();

      String result = <strong>Deencapsulation.getField(tested, "result");</strong>
      assertEquals("expected result", result);
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   The utility methods mentioned above are actually defined in the <code class="type">Invocations</code> base class,
   and therefore they are also available to <code class="type">Verifications</code> subclasses.
   This allows invocations to private methods and constructors to be verified in a verification block, just like they
   can be recorded in an expectation block.
</p>
<p>
   The <code class="type">mockit.Deencapsulation</code> class used at the end of the test is a separate utility
   class which contains those same Reflection-based utilities.
   It's a more generally useful class, since it can be called from any place in test code.
   Its methods are all <code>static</code>, so they can be statically imported for easier access.

<p>
   By default, <em>all</em> methods and constructors which can be called on a mocked type <em>and</em> its super-types
   (except for <code class="annotation">java.lang.Object</code>) get mocked.
   This is appropriate for most tests, but in some situations we might need to <em>select</em> only certain methods or
   constructors to be mocked; or we might prefer to <em>exclude</em> certain methods/constructors from being mocked.
   Methods/constructors not mocked in an otherwise mocked type will execute normally when called.
</p>

<h4 id="staticPartial">Static partial mocking</h4>
<p>
   Methods and constructors to be mocked can be explicitly specified through the
   <code><span class="annotation">@Mocked</span>(<strong>methods</strong> = {"filter1", "filter2", ...})</code>
   annotation attribute.
   Each filter value is composed of an optional regular expression (<code>java.util.regex</code>) that matches method
   names, followed by an also optional parenthesized list of parameter type names.
   The following example test shows several ways to use these mocking filters.
</p>
<pre><code>public class MyTestClass
{
   @Mocked(<strong>"nanoTime"</strong>) final System system = null;
   @Mocked(<strong>"print"</strong>) final JComponent component = new JButton();

   @Test
   public void staticPartialMocking(@Mocked(<strong>methods = "()", inverse = true</strong>) final Graphics graphics)
   {
      ...

      new Expectations() {
         @Mocked(<strong>{"(int)", "doInternal()", "[gs]etValue", "complexOperation(Object)"}</strong>)
         Collaborator mock;

         {
            graphics.setClip(0, 0, 80, 60);
            graphics.translate(-15, -12);
            component.print(graphics);

            mock.getValue();
         }
      };

      ...
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   For convenience, the <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code> annotation defines the default
   <strong><code>value</code></strong> attribute as a synonym for the <code>methods</code> attribute.
   This is what allows us to write <code><span class="annotation">@Mocked</span>("nanoTime")</code>, as shown above.
</p>
<p>
   The <code>inverse</code> attribute, which is <code>false</code> by default, inverts the meaning of the specified
   filters.
   For example, while <code><span class="annotation">@Mocked</span>("nanoTime")</code> or
   <code><span class="annotation">@Mocked</span>(methods = "nanoTime", inverse = false)</code> select only the
   <code>System#nanoTime()</code> method to be mocked, the inverse specification
   <code><span class="annotation">@Mocked</span>(methods = "nanoTime", inverse = <strong>true</strong>)</code> select
   it as the only method <em>not</em> mocked in the <code class="type">java.lang.System</code> class.
</p>
<p>
   To select constructors, we leave the first part of the filter (which corresponds to method names) empty and specify
   the parameter type names between parentheses.
   Commas are used to separate parameters, when more than one.
   A parameter type name can be fully qualified or a <em>unique suffix</em> of the full name.
   In practice, this means that it's almost never necessary to specify package names for a reference type.
</p>
<p>
   Specifying parameter types in a filter for a <em>method</em> is also perfectly valid, but usually unnecessary.
   It might only be required when the method is overloaded.
</p>
<p>
   Finally, notice that when the mocked type is a class, a mocking filter will match methods/constructors defined
   anywhere in the class hierarchy, from the mocked class up to (but not including) <code class="type">Object</code>.
</p>

<h4 id="dynamicPartial">Dynamic partial mocking</h4>
<p>
   Static partial mocking has the inconvenience that we need to explicitly specify the methods/constructors to be mocked
   or not mocked, and do so inside strings instead of in Java code.
   In short, it entails extra work and is not "refactoring friendly".
</p>
<p>
   An alternative that avoids both problems is to let JMockit figure out whether to execute the real implementation of
   methods/constructors during the <em>replay</em> phase, based on which invocations were recorded and which were not.
   We describe this feature as <em>dynamic</em> partial mocking, since the decision of what gets mocked is made at
   runtime, as invocations to mocked types get matched against recorded expectations.
   The following example tests will demonstrate it.
</p>
<pre><code>public final class DynamicPartialMockingTest
{
   static class Collaborator
   {
      private final int value;

      Collaborator() { value = -1; }
      Collaborator(int value) { this.value = value; }

      int getValue() { return value; }
      final boolean simpleOperation(int a, String b, Date c) { return true; }
      static void doSomething(boolean b, String s) { throw new IllegalStateException(); }
   }

   @Test
   public void dynamicallyMockAClass()
   {
      new Expectations(<strong>Collaborator.class</strong>) {{
         new Collaborator().getValue(); <em>result</em> = 123;
      }};

      // Mocked:
      Collaborator collaborator = new Collaborator();
      assertEquals(123, collaborator.getValue());

      // Not mocked:
      assertTrue(collaborator.simpleOperation(1, "b", null));
      assertEquals(45, new Collaborator(45).value);
   }

   @Test
   public void dynamicallyMockAnInstance()
   {
      final Collaborator collaborator = new Collaborator(2);

      new NonStrictExpectations(<strong>collaborator</strong>) {{
         collaborator.simpleOperation(1, "", null); <em>result</em> = false;
         Collaborator.doSomething(<em>anyBoolean</em>, "test");
      }};

      // Mocked:
      assertFalse(collaborator.simpleOperation(1, "", null));
      Collaborator.doSomething(true, "test");

      // Not mocked:
      assertEquals(2, collaborator.getValue());
      assertEquals(45, new Collaborator(45).value);
      assertEquals(-1, new Collaborator().value);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   As shown above, the <strong><code>Expectations(Object...)</code></strong> and
   <strong><code>NonStrictExpectations(Object...)</code></strong> constructors accept one or more classes or objects to
   be partially mocked.
   If the <code>Class</code> object for a given class is passed, the methods and constructors defined in that class are
   considered for mocking, but <em>not</em> the methods and constructors of its super-classes.
   If an <em>instance</em> of a given class is passed, then all methods defined in the whole class hierarchy, from the
   concrete class of the given instance up to (but not including) <code>Object</code>, are considered for mocking;
   the constructors of these classes, however, are <em>not</em> (since an instance was already created).
</p>
<p>
   Notice that in these two example tests there is no mock field or mock parameter.
   Dynamic mocking effectively provides yet another way to specify mocked types.
   It also lets us turn objects stored in <em>local variables</em> into mocked instances.
   Such objects can be created with any amount of state in internal instance fields; they will keep that state when
   mocked.
</p>
<p>
   As we saw, dynamic mocking is based on a simple rule for deciding whether an invocation at replay time should execute
   the real implementation or not: if it matches a recorded expectation, it gets mocked; otherwise, the real
   implementation gets executed.
   Although simple, this rule can produce surprising results, in particular when <em>strict</em> expectations are
   recorded.
   For example, if you record a strict expectation on a dynamically mocked object with a maximum invocation count of
   <em>n</em> (either the default of <code>1</code> or a value specified with <code>times</code> or
   <code>maxTimes</code>), then only the first <em>n</em> invocations during replay will match the expectation;
   the next invocation, if it occurs, will cause the real method implementation to be executed, instead of causing the
   test to fail with an "unexpected invocation" error.
</p>
<p>
   It's also valid to pass the mocked instances automatically created for mock fields or parameters into those
   expectation block constructors.
   In this case, the declaration of such dynamically mocked mock fields/parameters can make use of the
   <code>Mocked</code> annotation and any of its attributes.
   We could even combine static and dynamic partial mocking for the same mocked class, although that wouldn't probably
   be of much use.

   When using complex APIs where functionality is distributed through many different objects, it is not uncommon to see
   chained invocations of the form <code>obj1.getObj2(...).getYetAnotherObj().doSomething(...)</code>.
   In such cases it may be necessary to mock all objects/classes in the chain, starting with <code>obj1</code>.
</p>
<p>
   The <strong><code class="annotation">@Cascading</code></strong> annotation provides this ability.
   Just like <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>, it can be applied to mock fields and mock parameters.
   Similarly to <code class="annotation">@NonStrict</code> and <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>, the use of
   <code class="annotation">@Cascading</code> on a mock field or test method parameter also implies that the type is
   mocked (this doesn't preclude use of <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code> on the same field/parameter, however).
   The following test shows a basic example, where the cascading mocked type is used in expectation
   and verification blocks. The test involves use of the <code>java.net</code> and <code>java.nio</code> APIs.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void recordAndVerifyExpectationsOnCascadedMocks(<strong>@Cascading final Socket mock</strong>)
      throws Exception
   {
      new NonStrictExpectations() {
         InetSocketAddress unused;

         {
            mock.getChannel().isConnected(); <em>result</em> = false;
         }
      };

      // Inside production code:
      Socket s = new Socket(...);
      ...
   
      if (!s.getChannel().isConnected()) {
         SocketAddress sa = new InetSocketAddress("remoteHost", 123);
         s.getChannel().connect(sa);
      }

      ...
   
      new Verifications() {{
         mock.getChannel().connect((SocketAddress) withNotNull());
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   In the test above, since the <code class="type">Socket</code> class was mocked with cascading, any calls to methods
   like <code>getChannel()</code> will return a <em>cascaded mock</em> object whenever they occur during the test.
   The cascaded mock will allow further cascading, so a <code>null</code> reference will never be obtained from methods
   which return object references (except for return types <code>Object</code> or <code>String</code> which will return
   <code>null</code>, or collection types which will return a non-mocked empty collection).
</p>
<p>
   By default, a new cascaded mock is created for each unique chain of method calls, starting from a given cascading
   type.
   If necessary, this default mock can be replaced with a regular mock, introduced though a mock field or parameter.
   To do so, assign the desired mock instance to the <code>result</code> field, right after the method invocation chain
   of interest.

   Our discussion of this feature will be based on the (contrived) code below.
   Realistic examples can be found in the <em>Timing Framework</em> and <em>Animated Transitions</em> sample test
   suites, available with the full JMockit distribution.
</p>
<pre><code>public interface Service { int doSomething(); }
final class ServiceImpl implements Service { public int doSomething() { return 1; } }

public final class TestedUnit
{
   private final Service service1 = <strong>new ServiceImpl();</strong>
   private final Service service2 = <strong>new Service() { public int doSomething() { return 2; } };</strong>
   Observable observable;

   public int businessOperation(final boolean b)
   {
      <strong>new Callable()</strong> { // Callable is a parameterized interface from java.util.concurrent
         public Object call() { throw new IllegalStateException(); }
      }.call();

      observable = <strong>new Observable()</strong> {{ // Observable is a concrete class from java.util
         if (b) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException();
         }
      }};

      return service1.doSomething() + service2.doSomething();
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   The method we want to test, <code>businessOperation(boolean)</code>, creates several new instances of classes that
   implement public abstractions.
   Most of these implementations are defined through anonymous inner classes, which are completely inaccessible (except
   for the use of Reflection) from client code.
</p>
<p>
   This kind of situation will probably not occur often in real projects, though.
   Still, we can write a test that <em>captures</em> such class definitions and instantiations as they happen during
   test execution, automatically mocking the implementation classes as they are loaded by the JVM.
   (As a matter of fact, classes that have been loaded previously will also get mocked for the duration of a given test,
   transparently and as needed.)
   The next test shows how it's done.
</p>
<pre><code>public final class UnitTest
{
   @Capturing Service service;

   @Test
   public void captureInternallyCreatedInstances(@Capturing(<strong>maxInstances = 1</strong>) final Callable&lt;?> callable)
      throws Exception
   {
      Service initialMockService = service;

      new NonStrictExpectations() {
         @Capturing(<strong>maxInstances = 1</strong>) Observable observable;

         {
            service.doSomething(); returns(3, 4);
         }
      };

      TestedUnit unit = new TestedUnit();
      int result = unit.businessOperation(true);

      assertNotNull(unit.observable);
      assertNotSame(initialMockService, service);
      assertEquals(7, result);

      new Verifications() {{ <strong>callable.call();</strong> }};
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Note that we used all three possible scopes for mocked types: a mock field of the test class, a mock parameter of the
   test method, and a local mock field of the expectation block.
   In all three cases the mocked type is either an interface or a non-<code>final</code> class, but instead of using
   "<code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>" we used the special annotation
   "<code class="annotation">@Capturing</code>".
</p>
<p>
   This annotation has an optional attribute which takes an <code>int</code> value specifying the <em>maximum</em>
   number of new instances of the mocked type that should be "captured" during the test; if not specified, there is no
   limit.
   <em>Any</em> (future) instantiation of a class that is assignable to the declared mocked type will be affected.
   For a non-<code>final</code> mock field, each captured instance will be immediately assigned to the field, up to the
   specified maximum number of instances.
   If any more instantiations occur they won't be assigned to the field, even though the classes to which such instances
   belong will still get mocked.
   However, if there is a second capturing field of the same mocked type, then those extra instances will get assigned
   to it up to the <em>its</em> maximum number of instances to capture.
   So, once a mocked type is declared to be captured, all implementation classes will get mocked for
   the test, no matter how many new instances are captured.

   Automatic instantiation and injection of tested classes

<p>
   Typically, a test class will exercise a single <em>tested class</em>.
   JMockit can help by automatically instantiating this class, and optionally injecting the relevant mocked
   dependencies.
   This is what the <strong><code class="annotation">@Tested</code></strong> annotation is for.
</p>
<p>
   A non-<code>final</code> instance field annotated as such in the test class will be considered for automatic
   instantiation and injection, just before the execution of a test method.
   If at this time the field still holds the <code>null</code> reference, JMockit will try to create an instance using
   a suitable constructor of the tested class, and make sure its internal dependencies get properly injected (when
   applicable).
   If the field has already been initialized (not <code>null</code>), then nothing will be done.
</p>
<p>
   For injection to be performed, the test class must also define one or more
   <strong><code class="annotation">@Injectable</code></strong> fields.
   Mock fields annotated only with <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code>, <code class="annotation">@NonStrict</code>,
   etc. are <em>not</em> considered for injection.
   On the other hand, not all injectable fields need to be <em>mock</em> fields; fields of primitive or array types can
   also be annotated as <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>, and will be equally considered when injection is
   performed.
   The following example test class will demonstrate.
</p>
<pre><code>public class SomeTest
{
   @Tested CodeUnderTest tested;
   @Injectable Dependency dep1;
   @Injectable AnotherDependency dep2;
   @Injectable int someIntegralProperty = 123;

   @Test
   public void someTestMethod()
   {
      // Record expectations on mocked types, if needed.

      tested.exerciseCodeUnderTest();

      // Verify expectations on mocked types, if required.
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   Note that a non-mockable injectable field must have a value explicitly assigned to it, otherwise the default value
   would be used.
</p>
<p>
   Two forms of injection are supported: <em>constructor</em> injection and <em>field</em> injection.
   In the first case, the tested class must have a <em>single</em> <code>public</code> constructor if it's a public
   class; a <em>non-public</em> tested class is also accepted, provided it has a single <em>package-private</em>
   constructor.
   Once the tested class is initialized with this single constructor, its non-<code>final</code> instance fields are
   considered for injection.
   For each such field to be injected, an injectable field of the same type is searched in the test class.
   If only one is found, its current value is read and then stored in the injected field.
   If there is more than one, the injected field name is used to select between the injectable fields of same type.

   Reusing expectation and verification blocks

<p>
   The simplest form of test code reuse with JMockit is the declaration of mock fields at the test class level.
   As the next example shows, the objects that are created and assigned to such fields (by JMockit or explicit test
   code) can be used in any number of test methods.
   The complete source code for this example can be found under
   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/source/browse/trunk/samples/LoginService">jmockit/samples/LoginService</a>.
</p>
<pre><code>public final class LoginServiceTest
{
   @Tested LoginService service;
   <strong>@Mocked UserAccount account;</strong>

   @Before
   public void init()
   {
      new NonStrictExpectations() {{ UserAccount.find("john"); <em>result</em> = <strong>account</strong>; }};
   }

   @Test
   public void setAccountToLoggedInWhenPasswordMatches() throws Exception
   {
      <strong>willMatchPassword(true);</strong>

      service.login("john", "password");

      new Verifications() {{ <strong>account</strong>.setLoggedIn(true); }};
   }

   private void willMatchPassword(final boolean match)
   {
      new NonStrictExpectations() {{ <strong>account</strong>.passwordMatches(<em>anyString</em>); <em>result</em> = match; }};
   }

   @Test
   public void notSetAccountLoggedInIfPasswordDoesNotMatch() throws Exception
   {
      <strong>willMatchPassword(false);</strong>

      service.login("john", "password");

      new Verifications() {{ <strong>account</strong>.setLoggedIn(true); <em>times</em> = 0; }};
   }

   // other tests that use the "account" mock field
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   The tests in this example test class exercise the <code>LoginService#login(String accountId, String password)</code>
   method (our <em>unit under test</em>).
   This method first attempts to look up an existing user account from the given login name ("accountId", which is
   expected to be unique among all accounts).
   Since several different tests are needed to fully exercise this unit, a non-strict invocation to the
   <code>UserAccount#find(String accountId)</code> method is recorded for all tests in the class, with an specific login
   name ("john") and the mocked account as the value to be returned.
   Remember, any given test can use multiple expectation and/or verification blocks.
   Such blocks can also be written inside shared "before" and "after" methods, respectively.
</p>
<p>
   Another form or reuse exemplified above is shown by the <code>willMatchPassword(boolean)</code> method, which
   contains another reusable expectation block.
   In this case, an invocation to the <code>UserAccount#passwordMatches(String)</code> method is recorded for any
   password value, with the resulting return value provided as a parameter to the reusable method.
</p>
<p>
   Yet another form of reuse for expectation and verification blocks is to create named subclasses instead of anonymous
   ones.
   For example, instead of having the <code>willMatchPassword(boolean)</code> method we could have a reusable inner
   class:
</p>
<pre><code>   <strong>final</strong> class PasswordMatching extends NonStrictExpectations
   {
      PasswordMatching(boolean match)
      {
         account.passwordMatches(<em>anyString</em>); <em>result</em> = match;
      }
   }

   @Test
   public void setAccountToLoggedInWhenPasswordMatches() throws Exception
   {
      <strong>new PasswordMatching(true);</strong>

      ...
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   It's important that such classes be declared to be <strong><code>final</code></strong>, unless they are intended to
   be used as base classes for further extension.
   Such non-<code>final</code> base classes must have names ending in "<code>Expectations</code>" or
   "<code>Verifications</code>", however; otherwise they won't be recognized as such by JMockit.
</p>
<p>
   Finally, reusable <code>Expectations</code>/<code>Verifications</code> subclasses can also be top-level classes,
   allowing them to be reused in any number of test classes.
