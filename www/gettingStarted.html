<h2>
   Getting started with the JMockit Testing Toolkit
   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit"><img align="right" src="tutorial/go-home.png" title="JMockit Home"></a>
</h2>
<p>
   The toolkit is provided as a versioned <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/downloads/list">zip file</a> that
   contains everything (jars, sources, documentation, and build files), and also as a set of Maven artifacts deployed
   to the Maven Central repository (under
   "<code>&lt;groupId><strong>com.googlecode.jmockit</strong>&lt;/groupId></code>").
   The mocking APIs and other tools are documented through a <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>,
   <a href="javadoc/overview-summary.html">API documentation</a>, and several
   <a href="samples.html">sample test suites</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="fullDistribution">Using the JMockit full distribution</h3>
<p>
   Follow these instructions to start using JMockit:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      Download the full distribution for the
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/downloads/list?q=label:Featured">latest release</a>.
      Alternatively, you can do an
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jmockit/source/checkout">anonymous SVN checkout</a> of the entire project.
   </li>
   <li>
      Unpack the zip file to any directory.
      This will create the "<code>jmockit</code>" directory containing the library jars, source files, samples,
      API javadocs, and additional documentation.
      If you want to build the JMockit project itself using Ant, then you should also download and unpack (to the
      "jmockit" dir) the <code>jmockit-libs.zip</code> file.
      To build with Maven, simply use the "<code>jmockit/main/pom.xml</code>" file from the full distribution, or from a
      SVN checkout.
   </li>
   <li>
      Add the library file <strong><code>jmockit.jar</code></strong> to your classpath (in your Java IDE project, Ant
      build file, and so on, as required).
   </li>
   <li>
      Depending on your development/build environment and on the base test framework used (JUnit or TestNG), you may
      have to do one more thing:
      <ul>
         <li>
            When using <strong>JUnit 4.5+</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>JDK 1.6+</strong>, verify that
            <code>jmockit.jar</code> appears <em>before</em> the JUnit jar file in the classpath.
            <br/>
            (Note for <strong>Eclipse</strong> users: when specifying the order of jars in the classpath, make sure to
            use the "Order and Export" tab of the "Java Build Path" window.
            Also, make sure the Eclipse project uses the JRE from a JDK installation instead of a "plain" JRE, since
            the latter ones lack the "<code>attach</code>" native library.)
         </li>
         <li>
            When developing on <strong>JDK 1.5</strong>, make sure that
            "<strong><code>-javaagent:<em>&lt;proper path></em>/jmockit.jar</code></strong>" (with the proper absolute
            or relative path to <code>jmockit.jar</code>) is passed as an initialization parameter to the JVM when
            running tests.
            This standard parameter causes the JVM to load the "Java agent" that JMockit uses internally for bytecode
            instrumentation.
            You may have to use it even on a newer JDK 1.6+, if its
            <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/attach/index.html">Attach API</a>
            implementation doesn't work with JMockit for some reason; typically, this happens with the IBM JDK 1.6.
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      Optionally, configure your IDE to find API source code and Javadoc comments in this same <code>jmockit.jar</code>
      file.
      API documentation in HTML is also available in the "<code>jmockit/www/javadoc</code>" directory, as well as
      <a href="http://jmockit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/www/javadoc/overview-summary.html">on-line</a>.
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
   For instructions on the use of JMockit from an <strong>Ant</strong> build script, see the
   <a href="tutorial/RunningTests.html#ant">relevant section</a> in the JMockit Tutorial.
   For <strong>Maven</strong>, see <a href="tutorial/RunningTests.html#maven">this section</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="mockingAPIs">Using the mocking APIs</h3>
<p>
   The JMockit mocking APIs can be used in tests written with any of the popular testing frameworks:
   JUnit 4 (version 4.5 or newer, including support for <code class="type">junit.framework.TestCase</code>) and TestNG
   (version 5.14 or newer).
   Lets now see how mocking is done with the available JMockit APIs, which are all imported from the
   <code>mockit</code> package.
</p>

<h4 id="mockObject">Creating a "mock object"</h4>
<p>
   In a test class, declare a <em>mock field</em> of the type you wish to mock, annotating it with a JMockit annotation
   such as <code class="annotation">@Mocked</code> or <code class="annotation">@Injectable</code>.
   When mocking a class, the latter annotation means that <em>only</em> the instance assigned to the mock field will
   have mock behavior; if it is not applied, <em>all</em> instances of the mocked class will be mocked by default.
</p>
<pre><code>import org.junit.*;
import mockit.*;

public class MyFirstJMockitTest
{
   // <strong>Mocked instances</strong> (rather than conventional "mock objects") will be
   // automatically created and assigned to annotated mock fields:
   @Mocked Collaborator mock1; // <strong>all</strong> current <strong>and future</strong> instances are mocked
   @Injectable AnotherDependency anotherMock; // only <strong>one</strong> particular instance is mocked

   @Test
   public void myFirstTestMethod()
   {
      // Any mock field can be used here or in any other test method of the class.
   }

   @Test
   public void testMethodWithMockParameter(@Mocked YetAnotherDependency testSpecificMock)
   {
      ...
   }

   ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>
   The template test class above shows something unusual: the second test method declares a parameter!
   Normally, JUnit/TestNG test methods are not allowed to have parameters.
   When using JMockit, however, such <em>mock parameters</em> are allowed and quite useful.
   In fact, it's best to use mock fields of the test class only when the mocked types are needed by most or all tests in
   the class. Otherwise, mock parameters (or <em>local mock fields</em>, which we introduce later) with scope limited to
   a single test are preferred.
   JMockit will always take care of instantiating the mocked type and either assigning the instance to the mock field
   (provided the field is not <code>final</code>) or passing it as an argument when the test method is invoked by the
   test runner.
</p>

<h4 id="testMethod">What exactly goes inside a test method?</h4>
<p>
   The following template shows the basic structure of a JMockit test method, when using the
   <em>Expectations & Verifications API</em> for <em>behavior-based</em> testing:
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void aTestMethod(<em>&lt;any number of mock parameters></em>)
   {
      // <strong>Record phase</strong>: expectations on mocks are <strong>recorded</strong>; empty if there is nothing to record.

      // <strong>Replay phase</strong>: invocations on mocks are "<strong>replayed</strong>"; here the code under test is exercised.

      // <strong>Verify phase</strong>: expectations on mocks are <strong>verified</strong>; empty if there is nothing to verify.
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   Each test method can be divided in three <em>execution phases</em>.
   First, one or more invocations on mocked types/instances are <em>recorded</em>.
   (In fact, it is perfectly valid to not record any invocation at all - more on this later.)
   Second, the production code/class/unit which our test method is supposed to test is exercised, typically with a call
   to a single tested method. Any invocations to mocked methods/constructors that were previously recorded will now have
   a chance to be <em>replayed</em>.
   Third, the test method can explicitly <em>verify</em> that specific invocations to mocked methods/constructors
   actually happened (or not) during replay. Again, it is perfectly valid for this phase to be empty, with no explicit
   verifications (but with <em>implicit</em>, automatic, verifications - otherwise no behavior would be tested).
   Note that we say "mocked methods/<strong>constructors</strong>".
   The mocking API handles mocked methods (of <em>all</em> kinds) <em>and</em> constructors in the exact same way: to
   record or verify expectations on them, you simply <em>invoke</em> them during the corresponding test execution phase.
</p>

<h4 id="record">Recording expectations</h4>
<p>
   In the "record" phase of a test, we can write one or more <em>expectation blocks</em>, inside which invocations to
   mocked types/instances are recorded.
</p>
<p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void aTestMethod()
   {
      new <strong>NonStrictExpectations</strong>() {
         @Mocked MyCollaborator mock; // a "local" mock field

         {
            mock.getData(); <em>result</em> = "my test data";
            mock.doSomething(<em>anyInt</em>, "some expected value", <em>anyString</em>); <em>times</em> = 1;
         }
      };

      // In the replay phase, the tested method would call the "getData" and "doSomething"
      // methods on a "MyCollaborator" instance.
      ...

      // In the verify phase, we may optionally verify expected invocations to "MyCollaborator"
      // objects.
      ...
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   There are two classes that can be used to define "expectation blocks": <code class="type">Expectations</code>
   and <code class="type">NonStrictExpectations</code>.
   The difference is in the default behavior for the recorded expectations.
   In the first case, all expectations associated to mocked types used in the block will be <em>strict</em> by default,
   meaning that the invocations are <em>expected</em> to occur during the replay phase in the same order as they were
   recorded, and that invocations not recorded are expected to <em>not</em> occur.
   In the second case, expectations are always <em>non-strict</em>, meaning that the invocations to mocked types,
   whether recorded or not, are <em>allowed</em> to occur in any order and in any number, including not at all.
   There is also a <code class="annotation">@NonStrict</code> annotation which can be applied to mock fields/parameters,
   to force only non-strict expectations on them, even inside an otherwise strict
   <code class="type">Expectations</code> block. 
</p>
<p>
   You may be wondering what are those field assignments in the example test above.
   This is indeed something that you won't see in any other mocking API. That said, it should feel very intuitive once
   the semantics are known:
   the <em><code>result</code></em> field takes the desired return value for the preceding invocation, while
   <em><code>times</code></em> takes the number of times the preceding invocation is allowed and expected to occur.
   (There is also a <em><code>minTimes</code></em> and a <em><code>maxTimes</code></em> field.)
   The <em><code>result</code></em> field also accepts a <code class="type">Throwable</code> instance, which would cause
   the corresponding invocation in the replay phase to throw the specified exception or error.
</p>
<p>
   Another interesting feature of the API is its support for <em>argument matching</em> constraints.
   The test above uses some of the special "<code>any</code>" fields, such as <code>anyString</code>,
   <code>anyDouble</code>, and so on.
   The API also provides a set of "<code>with(...)</code>" methods, such as <code>withNotNull()</code>,
   <code>withSameInstance(T)</code>, etc.
   Arbitrary user-defined matchers can be provided through a call to the <code>with(Delegate)</code> method.
   Finally, it should be noted that, differently from most other mocking APIs, JMockit does <em>not</em> require a
   matcher for <em>every</em> parameter;
   any subset of parameters can have matching constraints, with actual values or objects being provided for the
   remaining ones.
</p>

<h4 id="verify">Verifying expectations</h4>
<p>
   When one or more types get mocked non-strictly in a test, we often end up with a non-empty verification phase.
   (If, on the other hand, all mocked types used in the test have only strict expectations, then all invocations get
   implicitly and automatically verified at the end of the test, with no explicit <em>verify</em> phase.)
   To explicitly verify invocations to non-strict mocked types/instances, we can write one or more <em>verification
   blocks</em> in the test.
   This allows us to make sure that the invocations we care about actually occurred during the replay phase.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void aTestMethod(@Injectable final MyCollaborator mock)
   {
      // Non-strict expectations are recorded, or perhaps there are no expectation blocks at all.
      ...

      // Code under test is exercised.
      ...

      new <strong>Verifications</strong>() {{
         // If no new instance of the mocked class should have been created with the
         // no-args constructor, we can verify it:
         new MyCollaborator(); <em>times</em> = 0;

         // Here we verify that the "MyCollaborator#doSomething()" method was executed at least once:
         mock.doSomething();

         // Another verification, which must have occurred no more than three times:
         mock.someOtherMethod(<em>anyBoolean</em>, <em>any</em>, withInstanceOf(Xyz.class)); <em>maxTimes</em> = 3;
      }};
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   The <em>Verifications API</em> is quite rich and flexible. Besides the <code class="type">Verifications</code> class
   shown above, which allows some invocations to be verified regardless of their order of execution, we have the
   <code class="type">VerificationsInOrder</code>, <code class="type">FullVerifications</code>, and
   <code class="type">FullVerificationsInOrder</code> subclasses.
   The "InOrder" suffix simply means that the relative order of the invocations appearing inside the verification block
   will have to match the actual order of execution of corresponding invocations during replay.
   The "Full" prefix means that all invocations that occurred during replay must be accounted for (verified) inside
   the verification block (excluding those which are verified implicitly, if any).
</p>

<h4 id="stateOriented"><em>State</em>-oriented mocking, <em>fake</em> implementations</h4>
<p>
   Sometimes you are more interested in checking the argument values passed to a mocked collaborator, instead of
   checking that the invocation to the collaborator was made from the client/tested method.
   Of course, you <em>can</em> check argument values through a recorded or verified expectation, but it becomes more
   difficult when those values are complex.
   In such cases it may be easier to use the <code class="type">MockUp&lt;T></code> generic class, as the next test
   shows.
</p>
<pre><code>   @Test
   public void stateBasedTestMethod()
   {
      new MockUp&lt;MyCollaborator>() {
         @Mock(invocations = 1) // (the invocation count constraint is optional)
         boolean doSomething(int n, String s, ComplexData otherData)
         {
            assertEquals(1, n);
            assertNotNull(otherData);
            ...
            // Return (if non-void) or throw the result we want to produce for
            // this invocation of the mocked method:
            return otherData.isValid();
         }
   
         // Other mock or regular methods...
      };

      // Exercise the code under test normally; calls to MyCollaborator#doSomething will execute
      // the mock method above; if more or less than one such invocation occurs, the test fails.
      ...
   }
</code></pre>
<p>
   The <code class="annotation">@Mock</code> annotation marks those methods in the <em>mock-up class</em> which are
   meant to provide mock/stub implementations for the corresponding methods (of the same signature) in the mocked class.
   If no invocation count constraint is specified through attributes of the <code class="annotation">@Mock</code>
   annotation, then any number (including zero) of invocations will be allowed.
</p>
<p>
   A <code class="type">MockUp&lt;T></code> subclass can also be used as a general-purpose <em>fake implementation</em>
   for the indicated type "<code>T</code>" (including <code>final</code> classes, classes with <code>static</code>
   methods, etc.).
   Such implementations can even be applied globally, by setting the "<code>jmockit-mocks</code>" system property or
   providing a "<code>jmockit.properties</code>" configuration file.
</p>

<h4 id="moreInfo">More information</h4>
<p>
   The examples above give only a brief overview of the available mocking APIs. There is more.
   The <a href="tutorial.html">JMockit Tutorial</a> contains an extensive discussion of nearly all methods, fields,
   annotations, etc., with many examples.
   The <a href="javadoc/overview-summary.html">API documentation</a> provides a detailed specification for all elements
   of the mocking APIs.
   Finally, there are hundreds of JUnit <a href="samples.html">sample tests</a> available under the
   "<code>jmockit/samples</code>" folder, which use nearly everything that is available in the APIs.
